### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Todd Ginsberg. I live in Raleigh, NC and work remotely for a payments company in Austin, TX. I love writing software and feel very fortunate to do it for a living. I have been using Java actively since 1995 and Kotlin actively since 2016. I have been using Spring Framework in some form or another (mostly via Spring Boot, lately) since 2004 (Yes - version 1.0!). I am a board member of the [Triangle JUG](https://www.meetup.com/Triangle-Java-Users-Group/) and a Co-Organizer of the [Greensboro JUG](https://www.meetup.com/GSO-JUG/).

I am a huge fan of the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com). I have repositories with idiomatic solutions in Kotlin for 2017 through 2020, as well as posts describing these solutions [on my blog](https://todd.ginsberg.com).

I enjoy public speaking and have recently spoken at conferences and user groups on the following topics:

- An Introduction to Kotlin
- Java Cram Session: Get caught up on the latest Java changes
- Advent of Code in Kotlin: Lessons Learned
