### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Todd Ginsberg and I live in Raleigh, NC and work remotely for a payments company in Austin, TX. I love writing software and feel very fortunate to do it for a living. I have been using Java actively since 1995 and Kotlin actively since 2016.

I enjoy public speaking and have spoken at conferences and user group meetings recently on the following topics:

- An Introduction to Kotlin
- Java Cram Session: Get caught up on the latest Java changes
- Advent of Code in Kotlin: Lessons Learned

### Fun Facts :fox_face:

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the ins and outs of Kubernetes
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on interesting Kotlin projects
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about whatever you feel comfortable asking. I enjoy talking about code, and discussing solutions.
